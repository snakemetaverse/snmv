      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Snake Metaverse on Solana is a nostalgic journey into the classic Snake game, a beloved experience that many people have fond memories of. Our goal is to bring this iconic game back to life, but this time, through blockchain technology—specifically the Solana blockchain—and the use of NFTs.<br>
      Solana was chosen for its high potential, low gas fees, and popularity in the developer community. The blockchain's scalability and growing ecosystem of developers make it the ideal platform to bring Snake Metaverse to life.</p>

      <h2>The Concept</h2>
      <p>The concept of Snake Metaverse is to take the traditional Snake game and reimagine it in the blockchain world. By integrating it into a metaverse environment, we aim to provide an engaging and fun experience.<br>
      NFTs will play a crucial role as "Pass NFTs" or "Access Pass NFTs," which means only players who own or hold these NFTs will gain access to the Snake Metaverse. These NFTs serve as the key to unlock the world of Snake Metaverse.<br>
      Unique features and gameplay mechanics will ensure players enjoy an exciting and immersive experience, where they can relive the joy of the classic Snake game while exploring the endless possibilities within a blockchain-based metaverse.</p>

      <h2>Blockchain Integration</h2>
      <p>Decentralization and blockchain are at the heart of Snake Metaverse. By leveraging Solana’s scalability and low transaction fees, we ensure that the game can handle a growing player base while keeping costs minimal.<br>
      Smart contracts are a vital part of the game’s economy. They facilitate secure transactions, enable automated gameplay mechanics, and ensure a fair distribution of rewards.</p>

      <h2>Economy & Tokenomics</h2>
